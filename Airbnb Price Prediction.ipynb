    "## Variable Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "In context of the research question, the variables we choose are specific to factors related to hosting experience that can be controlled by Airbnb hosts. In addition to location, which is backed by research to have significant positive effect on prices[1], our full model will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Price: price per night in Euros.\n",
    "\n",
    "- location score: accessibility and how well the place is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "- cleanliness score: cleanliness of the place.\n",
    "\n",
    "- communication score: How well did the host communicates with their guests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- check-in score: Check-in experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "- accuracy score: Was it accurately represented with up-to-date photos and info?\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: We are hoping to include all of the above variables in our final model to see which of them have significant effects on price. The primary goal is to construct a model where our T-tests and estimated coefficients are reliable, accurate, and representative of the population. Therefore, the \"best\" model will ideally have good model assumptions and low degree of collinearity(VIF); Goodness of fit(AIC, corrected AIC, BIC, adjusted $R^2$) will be of secondary importance. \n",
    "\n",
    "*In this study, we will only include listings which have reviews of over 50 because we want to look at experienced Airbnb hosts and their pricing strategies, rather than hosts who just started their Airbnb business and are playing around with different pricing strategies."

Then, we will check residual plots to see if linearity assumption, uncorrelated errors assumption, and constant variance assumption hold. Specifically, we are looking for random scattered points around 0. eg. no curves, fanning out pattern, and no large clusters of residuals that have obvious separation from the rest. Lastly, we will check the normality assumption. We are looking for a straight diagonal string of points with minimal deviations at the ends. If any of the conditions or assumptions are not satisfied, we will use box-cox transformation or other variable transformation to try and correct them."

    "## Auto Selection Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Starting with the full model after variable transformations, we will use the all possible subsets method to fit the \"best\" models(in terms of adjusted $R^2$) of different number of predictors. We will choose the best 5 models for models of different sizes, eg. top 5 models with two predictors, three predictors, and so on. This way, we get to examine different models with different combinations of predictors without penalizing and eliminating the ones with relatively lower $R^2$ but possibly have better model assumptions and lower VIF's. We will also use auto selection methods for backward, forward, step-wise approaches using measure of AIC and BIC and use them as our potential models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. With all the possible models, we will start by eliminating the ones with very high collinearity(VIF values) and the ones with bad model assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We will then compare AIC, corrected AIC, BIC, adjusted $R^2$ for the models with relatively good model assumptions and low VIF's, and eliminate the ones with high AIC, corrected AIC, BIC values and low adjusted R^2(generally bad fit of model for data).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Lastly, with the remaining models, we will select our final model based on how well it does overall in terms of degree of collinearity, model assumptions, and goodness of fit using measures previously mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will be split randomly to a 1:1 ratio without replacement. We will use the training dataset to perform model building and diagnostics. The test dataset will be used to validate our final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by performing a small EDA to check if there are major differences in the two datasets in terms of their means and standard deviations. If the difference is big, then it can potentially be the reason we cannot validate our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have our final model, we will compare it to the same model fit on the test dataset. We are hoping to see similar properties. Specifically, we are hoping to see minimal differences in the estimated coefficients, p-values, same predictors appearing as significant, minimal changes in model assumptions, similar residual sum of squares($RSS$), and adjusted $R^2$. We do not want to see new, or worse model violations. The differences in estimated coefficients should be within two standard errors of coefficients in the training data.\n",

    "We see that the T-test for variable, cleanliness, is not significant, which means how clean a room is might not have significant impact on its price. When all other variables are held constant, when accuracy score increases by 1, $log(price)$ decreases by 0.727. This indicates how accurate a listing is described with up-to-date photos and info has a negative impact on price. One possible explanation is when photos and information of a listing are \"enhanced\" or described better than it actually is, hence worse accuracy, Airbnb hosts tend to be able to charge more. When checkin score increases by 1, $log(price)$ increases by 0.496. This means hosts who provide better check-in experience for guests are able to charge more for their rooms. When location score is increased by 1, the $log(price)$ is increased by 0.810. This means when a listing is well-located, hosts are able to charge more. "

Other transformations may have improved normality assumption but were ultimately not used because they jeopardized other conditions and assumptions. Our inability to validate the final model may be due to the differences in observations and large number of influential points in both datasets.\n",
